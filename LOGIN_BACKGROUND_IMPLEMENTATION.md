# Login Background Image Implementation

## Overview
Updated the login page to display the highway interchange background image under the login form in the right column at 40% opacity.

## Implementation Details

### Background Image Setup
- **Image Source**: `/background/3PL_Getty1028215246.webp`
- **Opacity**: 40% (0.4)
- **Position**: Center center
- **Size**: Cover (scales to fill container)
- **Enhancement**: Brightness and contrast filters for better text readability

### CSS Implementation
```css
.login-bg-image {
  background-image: url('/background/3PL_Getty1028215246.webp');
  background-size: cover;
  background-position: center center;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  opacity: 0.4;
  filter: brightness(1.1) contrast(0.9);
}
```

### Layout Structure
The right column of the login page uses a layered approach:

1. **Base Container**: Right column with responsive width
2. **Accent Background**: Color overlay with accent color at 46% opacity
3. **Image Background**: Highway interchange image at 40% opacity
4. **Content Layer**: Login/registration form with higher z-index

### Visual Design
- **Subtle Visibility**: 40% opacity ensures the image is visible but doesn't interfere with form readability
- **Professional Appearance**: Highway interchange theme aligns with transportation management context
- **Enhanced Contrast**: Brightness and contrast filters improve text legibility over the image
- **Responsive Design**: Background scales properly on all screen sizes

### User Experience Benefits
