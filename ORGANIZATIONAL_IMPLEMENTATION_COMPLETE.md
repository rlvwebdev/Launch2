- âœ… **Resource-based permissions** (Drivers, Trucks, Loads, Users, Settings, etc.)
- âœ… **Action-based permissions** (Create, Read, Update, Delete, Approve, Assign)

### **Demo Data & Testing**
- âœ… **Complete organizational hierarchy demo data**:
  - Launch Transportation Solutions (Company)
  - Southwest Division
  - Operations Department & Maintenance Department

- âœ… **Working development server** with live preview

## ðŸŽ¯ KEY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED

### **Multi-Tenant Data Isolation**
- Users only see data from organizations they have access to
- Automatic filtering based on organizational context
- Hierarchical access control (higher levels can see lower levels)

### **Organizational Management**
- Complete CRUD interface for managing organization hierarchy
- Form-based creation and editing of organizations
- Real-time organization switching with permission validation
- Visual hierarchy representation with status indicators

### **Permission System**  
- Role-based access control with organizational scoping
- Permission checking throughout the application
- Context-aware UI elements that show/hide based on permissions
- Hierarchical permission inheritance

### **Mobile-First Design**
- Organization selector in mobile header
- Touch-friendly organization management interface
- Responsive design that works on all device sizes
- Bottom navigation preserved with organizational context

### **Developer Experience**
- Type-safe organizational context throughout the application
- Reusable hooks for organizational data access
- Clean separation of concerns with context providers
- Comprehensive error handling and validation

## ðŸ›  TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### **Context Providers**
```
App Layout
â”œâ”€â”€ OrganizationalProvider (organizational state & permissions)
â”œâ”€â”€ DataProvider (data management with filtering)
â””â”€â”€ SidebarProvider (UI state)
```

### **Data Flow**
```
User Login â†’ Organization Access Check â†’ Set Current Organization â†’ 
Filter Data by Organizational Context â†’ Display in UI
```

### **Permission Hierarchy**
```
System Admin (all access)
â”œâ”€â”€ Company Admin (company-wide access)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Division Manager (division-level access)  
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Department Manager (department-level access)
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Terminal Manager (terminal-level access)
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ User (own records only)
```

## ðŸš€ PRODUCTION READY

The implementation is **production-ready** with:
- âœ… **Type-safe TypeScript implementation**
- âœ… **Comprehensive error handling**
- âœ… **Form validation and user feedback**
- âœ… **Mobile-responsive design**
- âœ… **Accessible UI components**
- âœ… **Permission-based security**
- âœ… **Hierarchical data organization**
- âœ… **Context-aware filtering**

## ðŸ”§ HOW TO USE

### **For End Users**
1. **Switch Organizations**: Use the organization selector in the header/footer
2. **Manage Organizations**: Navigate to /organizations page (admin only)
3. **View Filtered Data**: All drivers/trucks/loads automatically filtered by current organization
4. **Add Organizations**: Use the "Add Organization" button with proper permissions

### **For Developers**
1. **Access Organizational Context**: `const { currentOrganization, switchOrganization } = useOrganizational()`
2. **Get Filtered Data**: `const { drivers, trucks, loads } = useOrganizationalData()`
3. **Check Permissions**: `const permissions = usePermissions(currentUser)`
4. **Add New Organizational Features**: Extend the OrganizationalContext provider

## ðŸ“Š DEMO DATA STRUCTURE

The application includes comprehensive demo data showing:
- **Launch Transportation Solutions** (Company)
  - **Southwest Division**
    - **Operations Department**
      - Houston Terminal (3 drivers, 2 trucks, 4 loads)
      - Dallas Terminal (1 driver, 1 truck, 2 loads)
    - **Maintenance Department**  
      - Houston Terminal (1 driver, 1 truck, 2 loads)

All data is properly organized with organizational relationships, demonstrating real-world usage patterns.

## ðŸŽ‰ IMPLEMENTATION SUCCESS
