# Theme System Overhaul - June 21, 2025

## Overview
Completely redesigned the theme system with improved light/dark themes, a new Monokai theme, proper system theme detection, and removed problematic gradients from navigation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Theme Context Enhancements

#### New Theme Definitions
- **Launch Light**: Professional blue/amber theme with white backgrounds
  - Primary: `#1e40af` (Blue-700)
  - Accent: `#f59e0b` (Amber-500)
  - Background: `#ffffff` (White)
  - Surface: `#f9fafb` (Gray-50)

- **Launch Dark**: Improved dark theme with better contrast
  - Primary: `#1f2937` (Gray-800)
  - Accent: `#fbbf24` (Amber-400)
  - Background: `#111827` (Gray-900)
  - Surface: `#1f2937` (Gray-800)

- **Monokai Theme**: VS Code inspired dark theme
  - Primary: `#272822` (Monokai background)
  - Accent: `#a6e22e` (Monokai green)
  - Background: `#1e1f1c` (Monokai darkest)
  - Surface: `#272822` (Monokai main)

#### System Theme Detection
- Added `themeMode` state: `'light' | 'dark' | 'system'`
- Automatic system preference detection via `prefers-color-scheme`
- Real-time updates when system theme changes
- Persistent theme mode storage in localStorage

#### Theme Management Functions
- `setThemeMode()` - Controls light/dark/system mode
- `getThemeForMode()` - Automatically selects appropriate theme
- `getSystemTheme()` - Detects system preference
- Proper useCallback optimization for performance

### 2. Settings Page Improvements

#### Theme Mode Selector
Added a new card section with three options:
- **Light Mode**: Always use light themes (Sun icon)
- **Dark Mode**: Always use dark themes (Moon icon) 
- **System**: Follow device preference (Monitor icon)

Each option shows:
- Clear visual distinction when selected
- Descriptive text explaining the behavior
- Proper hover states and transitions
- Accent-colored borders when active

#### Enhanced Theme Integration
- Updated `useTheme` destructuring to include new properties
- Connected theme mode selector to context functions
- Proper state management and persistence

### 3. Navigation Cleanup

#### Removed Problematic Gradients
- **Sidebar background**: Now uses solid `bg-[var(--theme-accent)]`
- **Header section**: Removed gradient, uses solid accent color
- **Navigation items**: Simplified to `bg-white/20` for active states
- **Bottom section**: Removed gradient, uses solid accent color
- **Hover effects**: Simplified to `hover:bg-white/10`

#### Improved Styling
- Better contrast with white text on accent backgrounds
- Simplified border styling with `border-white/20`
- Removed complex gradient calculations
- Consistent styling across all navigation elements

### 4. Mobile Navigation Updates

#### Bottom Navigation
- Updated background to use surface gradients appropriately
- Fixed active/hover states to use accent colors
- Improved more menu styling with proper gradients
- Better visual hierarchy and contrast

## Technical Improvements

### Performance Optimizations
- Used `useCallback` for theme functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Proper dependency arrays in useEffect hooks
- Efficient theme switching without full re-renders

### Type Safety

- Better error handling and fallbacks

### Browser Compatibility

## User Experience Enhancements

- Descriptive labels explaining each option
- Immediate feedback when changing modes
- Persistent preferences across sessions

### Professional Appearance
