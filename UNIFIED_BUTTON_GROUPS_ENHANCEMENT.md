# Report Page Button Group Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the Reports page to create unified button groups that appear as single, cohesive UI elements instead of individual separated buttons. This provides a more professional and polished appearance consistent with modern web application design patterns.

## Changes Made

### 1. Tab Navigation Button Group
**Before**: Individual buttons with gaps between them
**After**: Unified button group with connected appearance

**Implementation**:
- Wrapped buttons in a container with unified border and background
- Removed gaps between buttons  
- Applied consistent border radius to the container
- Active state now highlights the selected tab with accent color
- Hover states provide smooth transitions between buttons

### 2. Integrated Organizational Navigation
**Before**: Separate dropdown selectors in the page header for Terminal, Region, and Division
**After**: Unified tab navigation that replaces dropdown functionality

**Implementation**:
- Tab navigation now controls the organizational context
- Removed separate OrganizationalSelectorGroup from page header
- Clicking tabs switches both the view and the organizational level
- Three organizational levels: Terminal, Region, Division

### 3. Date Range Button Group
**Before**: Individual outline buttons scattered across the interface
**After**: Unified button group with cohesive design

**Implementation**:
- Created segmented control appearance
- Centered the button group for better visual balance
- Shortened labels for compact design ("Recent" vs "Recent Activity")
- Consistent styling with tab navigation group

### 4. Enhanced Visual Design

#### Button Group Container
```css
.inline-flex rounded-lg border border-[var(--color-neutral)]/30 bg-[var(--color-surface)] p-1
```

#### Active Button State
```css
bg-[var(--color-accent)] text-white shadow-sm
```

#### Inactive Button State
```css
text-[var(--color-text-secondary)] hover:text-[var(--color-text)] hover:bg-[var(--color-background)]
```
